# Trackgenix S.A
The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies.
In the development of a web system which we will call "Trackgenix" that will facilitate the
registration of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team, we must start with the
HTML structure of the landing page of the system requested by the company.
## Usage
